# 4️⃣ Document Storage and Organization

**Exercise 4 – Organizing documents using folders, tags, and versioning**  
📅 Duration: 1 hour

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to organize documents effectively by using folder structures, tags (labels), and version control, and to understand the benefits of these practices in a document management system.

---

## 📝 Learning outcomes

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- Explain the difference between folder-based and tag-based organization.
- Create a logical folder structure for organizing documents.
- Apply tags or labels to categorize documents.
- Use basic version control to track document changes.

## 🔍 Task description

### 1. **Folder structure**
Design and create a folder hierarchy to organize documents for a fictional small business, for example:
/CompanyDocuments
/HR
/Finance
/Projects
/ProjectA
/ProjectB

You can adjust the structure to fit another example scenario if you prefer.

---

### 2. **Tagging**
Select at least 5 example documents and assign them **tags/labels** that reflect their content, such as:
- `HR`, `Confidential`, `Invoice`, `Report`, `Legal`

You can simulate tagging by naming the file with tags in brackets, e.g.:  
`[HR][Confidential] Employee_Contract.docx`

If you are using a system that supports real tags (like Nextcloud), use the built-in tagging feature.

---

### 3. **Versioning**
Choose one document (e.g., `Report.docx`) and create at least 3 different versions of it:
- `Report_v1.docx`
- `Report_v2.docx`
- `Report_final.docx`

Alternatively, if you are using a version control system (like git or Nextcloud with versioning), commit/save changes and list the versions created by the system.

---

## 📄 Deliverables

At the end of this exercise, submit:
✅ Screenshot or description of your folder structure  
✅ List of documents with assigned tags  
✅ List or screenshot showing different versions of one document

---

## 🛠️ Suggested tools

- File explorer on your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Nextcloud (if available)
- Git (optional)

---

## 💡 Tips

- Think about scalability: Would your folder structure still work with hundreds of documents?
- Tags can help you find documents that fit into multiple categories (e.g., `Finance` and `Confidential`).
