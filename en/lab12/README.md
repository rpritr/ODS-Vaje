# Project Assignment: Design a Document Management System for a Company

## Objective  
The goal of this assignment is for you to design a comprehensive document management system (DMS) for a hypothetical (or real) company in a specific business field. You will describe the company and its business processes, analyse its document/workflow needs, and propose a structured DMS solution (e.g. using SharePoint or a similar platform). As part of the project you’ll create a folder/metadata structure, define workflows and access controls, and provide an example of how the DMS would be used in practice.

## Requirements  

1. **Company description & business context**  
   - Choose (or invent) a company in a specific field (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare, legal, logistics, marketing, etc.).  
   - Provide background: what the company does, size (approximate number of employees), main departments / divisions, and a high-level overview of its business processes.  
   - Identify what kinds of documents the company handles (e.g. contracts, invoices, HR records, reports, technical drawings, correspondence, etc.).  

2. **Current (or hypothetical) document/workflow analysis**  
   - Describe how documents are currently managed (or *would be* managed without a formal DMS): where documents are stored, who has access, how versioning works (or doesn’t), how sharing and collaboration happen, what the pain points are (e.g. lost documents, outdated versions, redundant copies, security issues, difficulty finding documents).  
   - Highlight the main problems and inefficiencies that motivate the introduction of a DMS.  

3. **DMS requirements & goals**  
   - Specify the objectives for the new DMS (e.g. centralised storage, version control, controlled access, better search, workflow automation, audit trail, improved collaboration, regulatory compliance, backup/archiving, etc.).
   - Define any non-functional requirements: security/access control, user roles and permissions, metadata/tags, retention/archiving policy, backup strategy, usability, scalability, etc. 

4. **Proposed DMS solution design**  
   - Choose a DMS platform (e.g. SharePoint, or another), and justify why it is suitable for this company.  
   - Provide a proposed folder structure and metadata taxonomy (or tagging scheme) for storing documents.  
   - Define user roles and permissions (who can read, edit, approve, archive, delete, etc.).  
   - Describe workflows for common business processes (e.g. document creation, review & approval, versioning, sharing, archiving).  

5. **Example usage scenario**  
   - Provide at least one concrete example scenario (e.g. a contract being created, reviewed, approved, archived — or an invoice workflow, or HR onboarding documents flow).  
   - Show step-by-step how documents flow through the system (who does what, which folder they go into, what metadata is applied, how versioning and permissions work).  

6. **Migration / Implementation considerations** *(optional but recommended)*  
   - If the company currently has documents in paper or in unstructured digital files, describe how you would migrate them to the DMS (e.g. scanning, digitizing, categorizing).
   - Suggest training or adoption plan for employees, and how to ensure consistent usage of the system (governance, guidelines, audits) over time. 

7. **Deliverables**  
   - A report that includes: company description, requirements, proposed DMS design, folder/metadata structure, user roles/workflows, and example usage scenarios.  
   - A diagram or simple visualization (flowchart, tree structure, table) of the folder hierarchy and/or workflow(s).  
   - A small prototype skeleton (folders + sample documents or placeholder files) showing the structure in the chosen DMS platform (or as a folder hierarchy).  

8. **Evaluation criteria**  
   - Clarity and completeness of company description and business context.  
   - Soundness of requirements analysis — do the identified pain points and needs justify the DMS design.  
   - Quality and logic of proposed DMS structure: folder / metadata design, roles & permissions, workflow definitions.  
   - Realism and completeness of usage scenario(s).  
   - Consideration of implementation, migration, governance or user adoption challenges (if included).  
   - Quality and readability of documentation (Markdown, diagrams, structure).

- [Company Overview](#company-overview)  
- [Current Document Workflow & Pain Points](#current-document-workflow--pain-points)  
- [DMS Requirements & Goals](#dms-requirements--goals)  
- [Proposed DMS Solution](#proposed-dms-solution)  
  - Folder / Metadata Structure  
  - User Roles & Permissions  
  - Workflows

You can adapt or extend this structure as needed (for example, you may add sections on Backup & Archiving, Compliance & Security, Audit Trail, etc.)

## Assignment Brief 

**Task:** For a company in a business field of your choice, design a Document Management System. Provide a full analysis of current document handling and pain points, define requirements, propose a DMS (e.g. SharePoint or similar), design the folder/metadata structure and user workflows, and show at least one example of actual usage. Document everything in a well-structured README (or project documentation), include diagrams or folder-structure visualization, and optionally build a minimal folder skeleton or prototype.  

**Goal:** Simulate real-world implementation of a DMS: understand why companies need organized document systems; plan a solution that matches business needs; balance usability, security, and management needs; and communicate the solution clearly.
